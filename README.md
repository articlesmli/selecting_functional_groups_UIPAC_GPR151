The approach is demonstrated in  "Hierarchical Functional Group Ranking via IUPAC Name Analysis for Drug Discovery: A Case Study on TDP1 Inhibitors" doi: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.05591

Leverage the information embedded within IUPAC names to generate a hierarchical ranking of functional groups based on their potency as activators of the GPR151 protein.
Using the information encoded in IUPAC names to obtain a descendent order list of the functional groups acting as activators of  GPR151 protein
